# 🎬 Movie Discovery App (Jetpack Compose)

## 📌 Project Name  
Movie Discovery App with Jetpack Compose  

## 👥 Team Members  
- **Abdelrahman Ahmed Farouk (Team Leader)** → (Navigation + Detail Screen + Unit Testing)  
- **Abdel Rahman Ahmed Abdel Latif** → (API Integration + Dynamic Display)  
- **Salah Magdy Ahmed** → (Project Setup + UI Design)  
- **Kyrollos Farid** → (Search + Security + Final Polish)  

## 💡 Project Idea  
The Movie Discovery App is a modern, native Android application built entirely with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**.  
The app allows users to **browse, discover, and search for movies** by fetching real-time data from a public API (TMDB).  
It emphasizes **modern Android development practices** such as declarative UI, clean architecture, security, and unit testing.  

## 🛠️ Technologies to Use  
- **Kotlin** (primary language)  
- **Jetpack Compose** (UI toolkit)  
- **Android MDC** (Material Design principles)  
- **Retrofit** (networking)  
- **Git & GitHub** (version control)  
- **Unit Testing**  
- **UI/UX Design**  
- **Security Best Practices**
