# üé¨ Movie Discovery App (Jetpack Compose)

## üìå Project Name  
Movie Discovery App with Jetpack Compose  

## üë• Team Members  
- Abdelrahman Ahmed Farouk (Team Leader)  
- Abdel Rahman Ahmed Abdel Latif  
- Salah Magdy Ahmed  
- Kyrollos Farid  

## üí° Project Idea  
The Movie Discovery App is a modern, native Android application built entirely with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**.  
The app allows users to **browse, discover, and search for movies** by fetching real-time data from a public API (e.g., TMDB).  
It emphasizes **modern Android development practices** such as declarative UI, clean architecture, security, and unit testing.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies to Use  
- **Kotlin** (primary language)  
- **Jetpack Compose** (UI toolkit)  
- **Android MDC** (Material Design principles)  
- **Retrofit** (networking)  
- **Git & GitHub** (version control)  
- **Unit Testing**  
- **UI/UX Design**  
- **Security Best Practices**  

## üóìÔ∏è Project Plan  

### Week 1: Project Setup and UI Design  
- Initialize Android project in Android Studio (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose).  
- Set up GitHub repository.  
- Design wireframes for main screens (movie grid + detail view).  
- Build static home screen UI with Jetpack Compose.  

**Deliverables:**  
- Android Studio project pushed to GitHub.  
- Wireframes for screens and navigation.  
- Static, visually complete home screen.  

---

### Week 2: API Integration and Dynamic Display  
- Integrate Retrofit for API calls.  
- Fetch popular movies and create data classes for JSON responses.  
- Display movies dynamically in a lazy grid with posters.  

**Deliverables:**  
- Functional networking layer.  
- Home screen displaying movies from the API.  

---

### Week 3: Navigation and Detail Screen  
- Implement navigation with Jetpack Navigation.  
- Build movie detail screen (title, synopsis, rating, release date).  
- Pass data from movie grid to detail screen.  
- Write unit tests for business logic.  

**Deliverables:**  
- Working navigation.  
- Dynamic detail screen.  
- Passing unit tests.  

---

### Week 4: Search, Security, and Final Polish  
- Add search bar to filter movies by title.  
- Store API key securely (gradle.properties).  
- Write project documentation (README).  
- Refine UI/UX (animations, loaders, error states).  

**Deliverables:**  
- Functional search.  
- Secure API key storage.  
- Polished, professional UI.  
- Complete documentation.
